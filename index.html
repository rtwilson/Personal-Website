	    Welcome! I am a second-year graduate student at Stanford
	    University. Currently, I am in the ICME program, but I am
	    looking to earn a masters degree in Computer Science with a
	    specialization in Computer and Network Security. My academic
	    interests lie in software virtualization, networking and
	    security. If you wish, you can email me at rtwilson [at]
	    stanford [dot] edu.

	  <h2> Work Experience </h2>
	  <p>
	    During the spring and summer of 2012, I completed an
	    internship at Nicira (recently acquired by VMware) working in
	    the Tools team. The Tools team creates, optimizes and repairs
	    build tools, which involves a combination of programming and
	    system administrator work. My primary project was to design a
	    distributed compilation system to improve build times on the second
	    phase of the process known as the “second make”. Not only was it
	    critical that the system reduce build time, it was imperative that
	    the system be resistant to failure. After completing this
	    task, the “second make”, once requiring 130 minutes, now
	    completes in 40 minutes, a 70% improvement. Furthermore, I created a
	    web application using the Django framework to aggregate and
	    visualize build information. I also added automated bug finding
	    using git bisect to Nicira's unit testing software.
	  </p>
	  <h2> Research </h2>
	  <p>
	    During the summer of 2012, I worked with Stanford’s computer
	    science research group MobiSocial to develop a mobile music
	    application for iPhone, known as Jinzora. I implemented remote
	    downloads and local caching features and integrated
	    Jinzora with the MobiSocial's social application Musubi for
	    Iphone to enable playlist sharing between friends.
	  </p>
	  <p>
	    During the summer of 2011, I conducted robotics research 
	    at UCLA with a team of students from Harvey Mudd College
	    under the guidance of Professor Jerome Gilles. Using a Xilinx
	    FPGA console and Matlab, we made significant progress toward
	    implementing robot swarm-to-swarm communication in real time
	    with another robotics team at the University of Cincinnati.
	    While communication between the two robot swarms was complicated
	    by dissimilar API's, we were able to perform simulations between
	    two virtual swarms over a network and measure the performance.
	    We also achieved real-time swarm-to-swarm communication
	    between a swarm of actual robots and a virtual swarm. In
	    particular, I wrote the code for the swarming algorithm on
	    both the simulated and actual robots, the network
	    communication scripts and the data parsing functions. I also
	    designed a barrier avoidance algorithm, which was successful
	    both in simulation and implementation. We published a paper
	    entitled "Robot Swarming Over the Internet," which was
	    submitted to the 2012 American Control Conference.
	  </p>
	  <p>
	    During the summer of 2010, I was among a team of students at
	    UCLA doing research in mathematical biology, led by Professor
	    Maria-Grazia-Ascenzi and Professor George Mohler. The goals of
	    this project were to mathematically model cell reproduction in
	    the growth plate and statistically analyze cell photographs to
	    confirm the accuracy of these models. My assigned task in this
	    project was to use image processing and statistical techniques
	    to accelerate data collection, which, before this point, was
	    done manually. The paper is published in Volume 285, Issue 1
	    of the Journal of Theoretical Biology as "Effect of
	    localization, length and orientation of chondrocytic primary
	    cilium on murine growth plate organization."

	  <h2> Teaching </h2>
	  <p>
	    I am a Course Assistant for CME 102 during the Winter 2012 and
	    2013 quarters. The class focuses on both the theory and
	    implementation of concepts in numerical analysis. The
	    programming language used in this course is Matlab.

	<div id="interests">
	  <p>
	    I am a frequent reader of Reddit and Hacker News. I also watch lots
	    of television shows (to name a few: Archer, Californication,
	    Parks and Rec) and stand-up comedy (Daniel Tosh, Louis C.K. and Dave
	    Chappelle are my favorites). In terms of my more active hobbies, I
	    also play volleyball, and go to electronic dance music festivals
	    and concerts often. Although it may be stating the obvious, I like
	    to program on my free time. Below is a link to my Github account.
